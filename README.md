# BattleBots
Code, documentation, and CAD model cloud space for TnTech's ARC BattleBots team.

The BattleBots team at ARC is dedicated to designing and manufacturing a robot(s) to fight other robots in a competitive environment. 
If you haven't seen or heard of Battlebots before a great place to start would be to take a quick look at the Battlebots tv show website: https://battlebots.com
